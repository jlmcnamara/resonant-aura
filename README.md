# Resonance AI

## Project Overview

Resonance AI is an interactive application designed to explore the concept of resonance between objects and a user's aura. It uses AI to analyze objects, generate fingerprints representing their characteristics, and match them to the user's aura, suggesting objects that might resonate with the user. This project serves as a demonstration of AI-driven interactions and creative applications of object recognition.

## Features

*   **Object Scanning and Aura Discovery**: Users can interact with the application to "scan" an object. The application simulates the process of discovering an "aura" associated with the object.
*   **AI-Powered Object Fingerprinting**: The core functionality involves generating a unique "fingerprint" for each object based on its scanned characteristics. This fingerprint is a digital representation used for matching.
*   **Resonance Matching**: The application matches object fingerprints to the user's "aura" (represented internally as another fingerprint), identifying objects that are a good match.
*   **Interactive UI**: Built with Next.js and styled with Tailwind CSS, the user interface is designed to be intuitive and engaging, providing real-time feedback and visualizations of the AI's analysis.

## Technologies Used

*   **Next.js**: A React framework for building server-rendered applications, providing routing, and optimizing performance.
*   **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for creating custom designs quickly without writing custom CSS.
*   **TypeScript**: A superset of JavaScript that adds static typing, improving code maintainability and reducing errors.
*   **AI (Conceptual)**: The project outlines a structure for integrating AI, with placeholders for object scanning, fingerprint generation, and matching algorithms. Future development could integrate with actual AI services or models.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

*   **Node.js** (>=18.17.0): The JavaScript runtime environment. You can download it from [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/).
*   **npm** (>=9.6.7): The Node.js package manager, which usually comes with Node.js. You can check your version with `npm -v`.
